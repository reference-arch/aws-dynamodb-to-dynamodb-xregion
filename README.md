# Data Pipeline DynamoDB to DynamoDB Copy Sample [both src and target tables are in different region]

## Overview

This sample shows how to build a DynamoDB Copy Activity pipeline that uses a S3 directory for temporary backup. Specifically, this sample shows copying data across two dynamodb tables in the different regions [any aws region except eu-central-1]. Temporary S3 folder will be cleared after the copy activity completes.

## Prerequisites

You must have the AWS CLI and default IAM roles setup in order to run the sample. Please see the [readme](https://github.com/awslabs/data-pipeline-samples) for the base repository for instructions how to do this.

You must also provide the S3Path of a S3 bucket with write permissions. See [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/UG/CreatingaBucket.html) for instructions on how to create an S3 bucket.

## Run this sample pipeline using the AWS CLI

```sh 
  $> aws datapipeline create-pipeline --name dynamodb_copy_pipeline --unique-id dynamodb_copy_pipeline
```

You receive a pipelineId like this. 
```sh
  #   -----------------------------------------
  #   |             CreatePipeline             |
  #   +-------------+--------------------------+
  #   |  pipelineId |  <Your Pipeline ID>      |
  #   +-------------+--------------------------+
```

```sh
  $> aws datapipeline put-pipeline-definition --pipeline-definition file://pipeline.json \
  --parameter-values myTempS3Folder=<s3://your/s3/temp/path> myDDBSourceTableName=<dynamodb source table> \
  myDDBDestinationTableName=<dynamodb destination table> myDDBSourceRegion=<region for dynamodb source table> \
  myDDBDestinationRegion=<region for dynamodb destination table> myS3LogsPath=<s3://logs/path>  --pipeline-id <Your Pipeline ID> 
```

You receive a validation messages like this
```sh
  #   ----------------------- 
  #   |PutPipelineDefinition|
  #   +-----------+---------+
  #   |  errored  |  False  |
  #   +-----------+---------+
```

Now activate the pipeline
```sh
  $> aws datapipeline activate-pipeline --pipeline-id <Your Pipeline ID>
```

Check the status of your pipeline 
```
  >$ aws datapipeline list-runs --pipeline-id <Your Pipeline ID>
```

You will receive status information on the pipeline.  
```sh
  #       Name                                                Scheduled Start      Status
  #       ID                                                  Started              Ended
